# Neural Style Transfer (Colabs)

Colab notebooks for Neural Style Transfer. Both notebooks are fully functional in Google Colab as of Jun 2021. The notebook for _style-transfer-pytorch_ is capable of producing larger images, as well as running **considerably faster** than the notebook for _Neural Style Transfer & Neural Doodles_. The notebooks produce quite different results though, so if you're not in a hurry, you may want to take both for a spin.

You may also be interested in putting some of the images – before or after style transfer – through [Neural Image Super-Resolution](https://github.com/olaviinha/NeuralImageSuperResolution).

## Latest: style-transfer-pytorch

**Colab for:** [style-transfer-pytorch](https://github.com/crowsonkb/style-transfer-pytorch) (more precisely [this fork](https://github.com/olaviinha/style-transfer-pytorch)) <br>
**Paper:** A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576

This noteook is a **batch processor**: instead of individual images, it takes **directories** of content images and style images, and styles each content image with each style image in the directories, saving output images to output directory.
