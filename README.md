# Neural Style Transfer (Colabs)

**Colab for:** [Neural Style Transfer & Neural Doodles](https://github.com/titu1994/Neural-Style-Transfer) <br>
**Paper:** A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576

This noteook is a **batch processor**: instead of individual images, it takes **directories** of content images and style images, and styles each content image with each style image in the directories, saving output images to output directory.
