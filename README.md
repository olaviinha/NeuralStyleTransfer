# Neural Style Transfer Batch Processor (colab)

This is a batch processor for [Neural Style Transfer & Neural Doodles](https://github.com/titu1994/Neural-Style-Transfer) 
to be run in Google Colaboratory, using Google Drive as data source and storage. 

It styles each content image in a directory with each style image in another directory consecutively, and saves final images in a third directory, all directories located in your Google Drive.

See [Neural Style Transfer & Neural Doodles](https://github.com/titu1994/Neural-Style-Transfer) for details.
